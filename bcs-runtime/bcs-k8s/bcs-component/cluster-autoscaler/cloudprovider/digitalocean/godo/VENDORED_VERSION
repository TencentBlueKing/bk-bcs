The godo package was vendored based on the following git SHA:

8d8fad298a2eb45d1139313816d50a9ab5e423cd

* We removed the `util/` folder because it's not needed 
* We vendored the dependencies by calling `go mod vendor` after checking out a new version

To upgrade to a new godo version do the following:

```
cd cloudprovider/digitalocean

# remove the godo folder
rm -rf godo/

# clone the godo folder 
git clone https://github.com/digitalocean/godo
cd godo

# checkout to new release, replace the version. Here we're using v1.19.0
git checkout v1.19.0 

# remove the .git and util/
rm -rf .git
rm -rf util/

# vendor all dependencies
go mod vendor

# edit this file to include that you're using now the latest version
```
