BlueKing Container Service (BCS, same below) is a container management and orchestration platform for the micro-services under the BlueKing ecosystem.

BCS has been running stably for more than three years in Tencent. After more than 30 of different architectures and different scales of service verification, the largest service consists of four independent clusters with more than 500 physical servers, nearly 6000 POD, and more than 30 namespaces for isolation.

BCS is part of the BlueKing ecosystem. Its overall structure is organized according to the BlueKIng PaaS system. This open source part is the BCS back-end, an atomic platform under the BlueKing, which mainly outputs service scheduling and service management capabilities. The web page of the BCS is partially presented by the BlueKing SaaS light weight application. The version of the SaaS can be obtained through the latest BlueKing Community Edition or Enterprise Edition; or through the [BlueKing Official Website] (https://bk.tencent.com/) to get open source information.
